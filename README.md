# Resume Portfolio
Used this [Youtube][Build a Portfolio Website with React and Sanity.io] !["Youtube Favicon"](https://youtube.com/favicon.ico) video as a reference on building this React Portfolio.

## Sanity CLI
Used Sanity CLI to compile ***Projects*** and ***Portfolio information*** all in one place.

Sanity commands to use in GitBash Terminal
- **sanity login** - I used my Gmail account to login.
- **sanity init** - initializes a new project with sanity

First be in the root folder then cd into portfolio, then:
- **sanity docs** - to open the documentation in a browser
- **sanity manage** - to open the project settings in a browser
- **sanity help** - to explore the CLI manual
- **sanity start** - to run your studio

### sanity start
Once started go to **localhost:3333** (or similar. It'll tell you which one to go to). Once logged in using Gmail I can **Post** content and add new **Projects**.
